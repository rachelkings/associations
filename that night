<p>it was the end of august. four days after you broke up with me. he picked me up at 9
and we drove to glendora park. we walked through empty swingsets and monkey bars and i followed him, quietly. 
he said that two months ago he’d never have expected to be spending his second last night in the city with me. 
we sat on a bench and he stretched and put his arm around me and i nestled my head into his shoulder. 
it felt so familiar, as if every first kiss starts like that. that was my first kiss with adam, anyway. <a href="home">not with you</a>. 
so when i felt his head move, i knew to look up and kiss him - and it was so different from anyone else, his mouth was firm where yours was soft. 
he took off his glasses and asked if i wanted to sit on his lap.
i was terrified and we ended up going back to his car. walking through the grass, swinging my hand. jacob holds hands the wrong way. it feels right now, though.
we continued in the backseat of the car and just as i was about to get on top of him, another car drove by, so we pulled into the empty parking lot at avondale. 
he took off his shirt and his necklace and he’s the first person i’ve been with who actually looks like an adult (maybe because he’s a year older, but jacob has always looked much older). 
and it was exactly how I imagined it (hastily the night before as he texted me) his facial hair on my fingers and the curves of his neck under my lips.
