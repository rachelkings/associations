<p>we decide that having sex is a terrible idea and let’s not do that ever again because we already feel pretty fucked up about the whole thing. so for the next few days we try this weird secretive intimacy and that gets you fucked up and we have this long and terrible conversation about it where i realize that i’m jacobing you while getting jacobed by jacob and i am probably a pretty shit person. it’s all bad and terrible and you say lots of things like you still love me and you can’t seem to stop loving me and you always wanted to write music for me but you couldn’t and it took losing me to provide inspiration or something like that. and then we sort it out and the next month and a half is just kind of a rinse and repeat of that week (except we don’t have sex again and <a href="over">things kind of smooth themselves out</a> a bit). i do feel guilty though, because kissing you feels Right and Good like the universe decided that we would fit perfectly against each other, but i am not in love with you. i do love you, i think, i really do care about you, but i’m not in love with you. and i am maybe falling in love with jacob. </p>
