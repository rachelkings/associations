				<p> 
					We shared a room for two nights in Montréal. The sweltering Quebec
					summer was worsened by the lack of air
					conditioning and the inescapable scent of cigarette smoke left by our hosts. The constant discomfort, the feeling of wanting to be as far apart as possible
					in the same bed (and hadn't we been so excited to fall asleep together?) culminated in
					a near-constant haze of discomfort. 
 					I loved Montreal, though. I loved the old
					university buildings and the breakfast restaurants that made you forget that you weren't in
					Europe. 
					I guess we'd already started falling out of love before that trip,
					but I'd convinced myself that everything would fix itself if we went away together. I remember on the first day, I offered to 
					take pictures of these girls, and after, they asked if you and I 
					wanted a picture together, and I reflexively declined. I knew that it would be a spectacle and you'd be mad at me for
					making you interact with strangers and I didn't have to even process that before saying no. I guess
					I realized that everything that had become natural wasn't making me happy. I wasn't making you happy,
					either. But I want to go back to Montréal. I want to go to the jazz club that we decided to avoid.
					I want to spend more time at the art gallery without having to find you because you wandered off,
					bored, not answering your phone.
