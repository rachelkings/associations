				<p> 
					We ate sushi on our last night alone, together, as a family, just my parents and I. Where were we that night?
					I can't really remember. A quiet rest stop off the highway. 
					Somewhere outside Victoria, maybe, on a bench overlooking the ocean. Someone had left their dog tied
				   to their truck bed and the dog kept trying to jump down and I couldn't stop imagining it hanging
				   from its leash or, forgotten, dragged along the dirt road by a careless driver. Nothing bad happened.
				   We were alone, and we were together. It wasn't about happiness (although we were happy) but rather
				   the bittersweetness of our last night on the west coast alone/together. We'd spent the first couple nights
				   with family, before embarking upon our own journey up the coast, but now we were returning to spend
				   the last night of our trip with them. (We'd planned the trip before staying with them, so we hadn't really
				   had any way of knowing that we'd barely be able to stand another minute with them. These were my
				   thoughts, at least. I'm horribly incapable of hiding my feelings, and my parents are the exact 
				   opposite.)
