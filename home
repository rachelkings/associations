<p>but the moment we’re in your house, in your room, i’m vulnerable again and we’re in your bed and you put your arm behind me so naturally and i kiss you so naturally and it feels right. it doesn’t feel wrong. there’s no <a href="jacob">jacob</a> and there’s no us being broken up and there’s no impending judgement of all of our friends. and i guess we keep making out (we’re here on the pretense of playing this game but that’s not going well) and i’m on top of you and i say something like “would it be wrong if we-” and you say no and so we do. and it’s sort of how i remember it (maybe worse, after being with jacob, and being with jacob is really great). it’s weird, because our bodies are perfectly matched and you know me perfectly and it works and it should work (me and jacob shouldn’t at all) but there’s just something off. maybe we’re too perfect together. something like that. i don’t have a good analysis for why the sex isn’t great. so we have sex and then it’s 
over and we both stand up and i say <a href="jared 2">“this doesn’t have to mean anything”</a> and you don’t say anything and then pretty soon after that, i go home, like nothing’s happened. </p>
